[REQUIRED] Name: Breanna Parker
[REQUIRED] Project Title: EZ PACK
[REQUIRED] Project Stack: PYTHON
[REQUIRED] GitHub Repo Link: https://github.com/breannaparker1991/EZ_Pack.git

[REQUIRED] Project Description: This project will include an option to make multiple lists depending on how far the trip is, where you're going, weather, and what you'll be doing. You can then create a trip with whichever lists you think you'll need and it will compile them together. 

[REQUIRED] New Programming Concept(s) I'm Planning to Learn: I've never had to compile multiple lists before, and I'm still learning django. 
[REQUIRED] Week 1 Features (to show at Review during Week 2)
- will be able to login and create/edit/update lists. 

[REQUIRED] Week 2 Features (to show at first office hour/lecture of Week 3)
- ***Finish CSS work (could be Bootstrap or another framework too instead of CSS)***
- be able to create a trip that will compile your selected lists. 

[REQUIRED] Product Backlog (If I have more time after completing my MVP, I'll start to work on...)
- I was thinking of trying to add an API but I'm not sure if there's any that would benefit my project.
